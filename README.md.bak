**ThatsTheSoundOfTheAlarm** will be a customizable alarm clock app that lets users set alarms with various features like sound, vibration, snooze, and more. The app allows you to store alarms locally using SQLite and supports easy customization. In the future, we plan to add features like syncing alarms across devices, smart wake-up features, and integration with weather data for a more personalized wake-up experience.

## Features to be Implemented

- **Alarm Screen Update**: The alarm screen will be updated dynamically when a new alarm is added.
- **SQLite database to store Alarms**: Alarms will be stored locally using SQLite.
- Set single and recurring alarms.
- Configure alarm sound, vibration, and snooze settings.
- Local alarm storage with SQLite.
- Customizable alarm labels and color coding.
- Sync alarms across devices (planned feature).
- Gradual wake-up with increasing alarm volume and vibration.
- Weather-based alarm settings (planned feature).
- Customizable snooze and stop buttons.
- And much more!
